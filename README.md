# Data Science Projects

Welcome to the **Data Science Projects** repository! This collection features various data science projects focused on data processing, visualization, and model building. These projects aim to demonstrate practical data science workflows and solutions to real-world problems.

## Objectives
This repository aims to:
1. Provide hands-on examples of data processing and analysis.
2. Showcase visualization techniques for extracting insights from data.
3. Explore predictive modeling and machine learning implementations.

## Projects Overview
Below is a list of current and planned projects in this repository:

1. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Clustering techniques for grouping customers based on behavioral data.

2. **Sales Forecasting**
   - Time series analysis and prediction models for sales trends.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Examples of handling missing data, outliers, and feature engineering.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizations and summary statistics to uncover patterns and insights.

5. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Building classification and regression models using sklearn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow.

## Structure
Each project is organized into its own directory and contains:
- **Notebooks**: Kaggle notebooks uploaded and formatted for GitHub.
- **Data**: Example datasets (if permitted by licensing).
- **README.md**: Project-specific documentation.

## Requirements
To work with the projects in this repository, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Popular data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
- 
# The plotly module consist dashboard charts which are live charts. we can intract with them.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-science-projects.git
   cd data-science-projects
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Navigate to a specific project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd project_name
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
